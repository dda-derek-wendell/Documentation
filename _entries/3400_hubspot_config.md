> The HubSpot Admin may wish to make configuration changes:

1. Configure properties shown when viewing contact and company records.

   See [HubSpot documentation](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/settings/how-can-i-set-default-properties-that-show-up-in-the-about-section-of-contact-company-and-deal-records)  
   The admin may wish to expose properties from the integration.   
    &nbsp;  

2. Configure properties shown when creating contact and company records.

   See [HubSpot documentation](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/settings/how-do-i-set-the-properties-that-appear-for-all-users-when-adding-contact-company-and-deal-records)  
   Properties added by the integration should not be shown for record creation. These properties are managed by the integration and will be overwritten if the user makes modifications. Note that HubSpot does not yet allow properties to be marked "read only."
