>This step is recommended but not a requirement.
>This step will create 3 seperate Process Builder processes.  There will be a process for Accounts, Contacts, and Leads.  These processes will run when a new account , contact or lead is created from Dodge Prospecting.
The processes will Add the value **"Dodge Link"** to the Account Source or Lead Source field and change the owner of the record to the user that created the record from Dodge Prospecting.

Suggested names for each Process Builder Process are:
<br>Accounts = **Set Source and Owner on Accounts to Dodge Link** 
<br>Contacts = **Set Source and Owner on Contacts to Dodge Link**
<br>Leads = **Set Source and Owner on Leads to Dodge Link** 

**Please Note:** These processes only affect newly created records. Records previously created by Dodge Prospecting will not be affected.
